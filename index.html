            <h1>Premise</h1>
            <p>HeartCapture!! Chorus Battle (HCCB) is an Otome game-themed chorus battle, with a storyline that 
                follows the plot of a fictional Otome game set in a Japanese high school. Teams take the role of 
                the main character in the game and are free to romance any of the seven capture targets (or maybe 
                more). They do this by taking on challenges that correspond to each of the capture targets' 
                interest and incorporating them into their entries. </p>
            <p>Do note that pursuing a capture target is not required to proceed in the CB. Affection points with 
                characters do not affect your score. For more information please check the section titled Character 
                Affection below.</p>
            <p>There are a total of three rounds, each themed around different story events. Each round lasts around 
                6 weeks, with 2 weeks of judging in between (with exceptions).</p>
            <p>HCCB is an elimination-based chorus battle, meaning that the lowest-scoring teams of each round will 
                not be able to continue. </p>

            <h1>Forming Teams</h1>
            <p>Teams must have at least two vocalists, but other than that there are no requirements to how many 
                vocalists or non-singing staff members one's team can have. However, teams can only have up to 12 
                members. Vocalists who also take staff roles only take up one member slot.</p>
            <p>Teams must elect a team leader as the main point of contact for the CB staff, as well as a backup 
                leader in case the regular leader is unavailable.</p>
            <p>Teams may be altered freely before round two takes place, but the HCCB staff must be notified each 
                time. </p>
            <p>You may only join one team. However, if your team is eliminated, you are allowed to join another
                 team afterwards.</p>
            
            <h1>Song Guidelines</h1>
            <p>Entries must be at least 2:15 minutes long, and no longer than 6:30 minutes. Any work past the 
            six and a half minute mark will not be judged. </p>
            <p>Songs can be in any language, including constructed languages, as long as an english translation 
                is provided to the judges. Be aware that we may not be familiar with all languages, and that we 
                are most familiar with English and Japanese.</p>
